<h1>Disparity Among NYC Middle School Test Takers Prevalent</h1>
<h2>The number of New York City middle-school students taking the English Language And Arts Test is a growing at a steady pace, but a distinct borough based pattern shows a clear discrepancy in test results</h2>

<h4>In 2012, WNYC reported the first Staten Island School closure in 10 years</h4>

<br>“Staten Islanders thought they were impervious,” 
<br>said Anne Marie Caminiti, an education advocate 
<br>who until recently worked for Parent to Parent 		
<br>of New York State. “Schools here tend to 
<br>operate better than many schools around the city.”
<br>
<br>But one of them has finally been singled out.
<br>
<br>Public School 14 Cornelius Vanderbilt in the 
<br>Stapleton area of Staten Island is among 
<br>19 schools the city has marked to be closed, 
<br>with the final judgment to come on Feb. 9 
<br>in a vote by the Panel for Educational Policy.
<br>
<br>At a raucous hearing at P.S. 14 on Wednesday 
<br>night, about 400 parents, students and teachers
<br>filled the auditorium as an overflow crowd sat 
<br>in a cafeteria down the hall. About 20 minutes 
<br>into the meeting, people in the audience began 
<br>shouting questions about the school’s future 
<br>at officials for the city’s Education Department 
<br>and criticizing the plans to close the school.
<br>
<br>It is no secret that the school, serving more than 
<br>660 students in prekindergarten through fifth 
<br>grade, has been struggling. In recent years, its 
<br>grade on its progress report card dropped from an A 
<br>to a C to a D.
<br>
<br>P.S. 14 ranked in the bottom 4 percent of 
<Br>elementary schools in the city in mathematics 
<br>and English language arts proficiency last year. 
<br>About 31 percent of students met state 
<br>standards on the math exam, while 
<br>just 23 percent passed the English exam.
