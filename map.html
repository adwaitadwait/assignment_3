<h3>Staten Island Needs More Schools</h3>

<br>City Adding 800 More School Seats On Staten Island
<br>
<br>
<br>The new seats are among 11,800 the School Construction 
<br>Authority and the Department of Education will add 
<br>with a $868 million allocation in an amendment to their 
<br>current five-year capital plan released on Thursday.
<br>
<br>Where exactly the new seats will go on Staten Island 
<br>hasn't been determined. The city is in the process of 
<br>choosing locations for three new borough projects.
<br>
<br>The 800 are part of 2,081 total seats the city will add 
<br>on Staten Island over the next five years. That amounts 
<br>to 1,736 elementary and middle schools seats and 345 
<br>high school seats.
<br>
<br>The city will spend $250.12 million to add the capacity 
<br>on Staten Island, encompassing five projects. The total 
<br>cost for Staten Island plans -- including expansion, 
<br>repairs and other needs -- is $646.15 million through 
<br>fiscal year 2019.
<br>
<br>A study released last November found that Staten Island 
<br>schools have some of the most overcrowded classes in 
<br>the city. 
<br>
<br>Despite the new capacity being added, there are still 
<br>unfunded needs in District 31's New Dorp and North 
<br>Shore subdistricts as well as the Staten Island 
<br>High School district.
<br>
<br>The city isn't able to fund an additional 1,136 seats 
<br>needed on the North Shore or 476 more for the New 
<br>Dorp subdistrict. The Staten Island High School district 
<br>needs 55 seats that are unfunded.
<br>
<br>Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Thursday that 38,000 more 
<br>school seats will be funded citywide in the next 
<br>five-year capital plan, which will begin in July 2019.
