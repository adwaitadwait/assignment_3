<h3>Staten Island Needs More Schools</h3>
<br>
<br>
<aside>
<br>City Adding 800 More School Seats On Staten Island
<br>
<br>The new seats are among 11,800 the School Construction 
<br>Authority and the Department of Education will add 
<br>with a $868 million allocation in an amendment to their 
<br>current five-year capital plan released on Thursday.
<br>
<br>Where exactly the new seats will go on Staten Island 
<br>hasn't been determined. The city is in the process of 
<br>choosing locations for three new borough projects.
<br>
<br>The 800 are part of 2,081 total seats the city will add 
<br>on Staten Island over the next five years. That amounts 
<br>to 1,736 elementary and middle schools seats and 345 
<br>high school seats.
<br>
<br>The city will spend $250.12 million to add the capacity 
<br>on Staten Island, encompassing five projects. The total 
<br>cost for Staten Island plans -- including expansion, 
<br>repairs and other needs -- is $646.15 million through 
<br>fiscal year 2019.
<br>
<br>A study released last November found that Staten Island 
<br>schools have some of the most overcrowded classes in 
<br>the city. 
<br>
<br>Despite the new capacity being added, there are still 
<br>unfunded needs in District 31's New Dorp and North 
<br>Shore subdistricts as well as the Staten Island 
<br>High School district.
<br>
<br>The city isn't able to fund an additional 1,136 seats 
<br>needed on the North Shore or 476 more for the New 
<br>Dorp subdistrict. The Staten Island High School district 
<br>needs 55 seats that are unfunded.
<br>
<br>Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Thursday that 38,000 more 
<br>school seats will be funded citywide in the next 
<br>five-year capital plan, which will begin in July 2019.

<p>School districts 31 (Staten Island) 24 (Queens) lead

<br>Both districts have an average of above 26K students 
<br>each year over the past five years.
<br>School district 16 (Brooklyn) has the smallest

<br>Across New York City’s vast school system, some schools 
<br>are packed with top performers while others enroll 
<br>mostly those who struggle.
<br>
<br>Schools Chancellor Richard Carranza has vowed to tackle 
<br>the school system’s stark inequities, and this year’s 
<br>state test results — which were released Wednesday — 
<br>provide a baseline against which to measure his progress.
<br>
<br>Changes to the annual exams in math and English mean 
<br>scores can’t be compared to previous years to gauge 
<br>student progress. But with the test expected to 
<br>remain constant for the next few years, the latest 
<br>round of results set a benchmark.
<br>
<br>That timing also coincides with Mayor Bill de Blasio’s 
<br>most high-profile education initiative: Universal 
<br>pre-K. Next year, the city’s inaugural class of pre-K 
<br>students will be in third grade and sit for state 
<br>exams, and de Blasio hopes the city’s investment 
<br>in free early childhood education will pay dividends.
<br>
<br>When it comes to the schools with the highest and 
<br>lowest share of students scoring “proficient” on 
<br>state exams this year in New York City, there are 
<br>hardly any surprises on the lists that follow.
<br>Many city schools only admit students based on 
<br>their academic performance, with the most selective 
<br>schools posting top test scores. Those that serve 
<br>disproportionately needy students — those who are 
<br>poor, have special needs, or are learning English 
<br>as a new language — tend to fall to the bottom of 
<br>the list. Aside from how selective a school is or 
<br>its student makeup, these results could also be 
<br>skewed by how many students refused to take the exams.
